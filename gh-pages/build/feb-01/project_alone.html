            <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>
                Alone is the first game I finished developing with the help of my friends testing the game.
                I developed the game before University in my free time while working as a Game Designer at ka:media interactive.
                </br></br>
                To create the game, I used Twine 2 an HTML-based editor for non-linear stories. The game combines storytelling and an open world.
                A great help in creating this game was Jesse Schell's book "Art of Game Design.
                </br></br>
                Alone is a text-based story adventure set in a dark empty space station/prison.
                The player moves through a labyrinth and has to solve a puzzle by exploring the game world.

    <h2>The Project Goal</h2>
    <p>
      The initial goal of Alone was to create a text-based dungeon crawler in which you have to fight monsters on a space station.
      However, due Twine 2’s technical limitation and me wanting to finally finish a game (I started multiple Unity projects I never finished), I cut the scope and refined the concept.
      As the result, I ended up with a small open world game in which the player must find several items to finish the game not involving any combat.

    <h2>Desinging The Experience</h2>

      <div class="six columns">
        <p>
          I wanted to create a game where the player feels lonely and uncomfortable.
          To achieve this experience, I began asking myself “What are the characteristic elements of this experience? How can I integrate these into the story, mechanics, and technology?”
          <br><br>
          On simple step was modifying the font-style and background another solution was how I tackle the descriptions. This could variate from giving generally less information to make sure the player fills in the blank to trickle information over time.

        <h2>Open World Design</h2>
        <p>
          After I refined the concept I began creating a layout of the space station on paper.
          <br><br>
          As a Sci-Fi fan, it was generally easy to get some ideas started and getting the first idea of how each room would look like and would be described to the player.
          After writing the first sections in Twine I realizes the amount of work I put on to myself and decided to make the game shorter and make sure there is a higher “Awesomeness per Second”.

        Each block represents a page the player can read. A page can be a room, event, or diary. Hubs can be recognized by connecting to a larger number of pages.
        <br>
        Thanks to the book "Art of Game Design" I had a better idea how to abstract the real rooms from the Level Design into nested and interconnected spaces.

    <h2 class="text-caps">Lessons Learned</h2>

    <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
    <h3>Good:</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        Something I find particularly interesting with text-based games is the fact that you have control over what the player is “seeing”,
        giving him enough information to fill out the blanks and creating tension.
      </li>
      <li>
        As this was my first game I finished I got my first experience in having to cut parts of the game to a more reasonable size and ensure I can finish it.
      </li>
      <li>
        it was very helpful to let a few friends playtest the game to make sure the resulting experience is the same as the intended.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is a great feeling when you design parts of a game to create a specific experience and your player getting this experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="six columns">
    <h3>What to do better next time?</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        You can’t enjoy the story yourself if you have written it.
        In addition, it becomes very hard to judge the experience yourself with a story heavy game. As obvious as it sounds this wasn’t clear from the beginning.
      </li>
      <li>
        While it was technically easier to create a game in Twine than in Unity or Unreal it isn’t as flashy.
      </li>
    </ul>
