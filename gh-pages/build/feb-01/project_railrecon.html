              </br></br>-->
              Rail Recon was the final project in my 1st Year of University.</br></br>

              The project was so successful it received an <u>award for being the best overall game within year 1 of our University</u>.
              </br></br>
              After another 6 months of bug fixing and polishing we <u>released</u> the game <u>on Steam on the 23rd of January 2018</u>.
              </br></br>
              The project brief's goal was to choose a 1980’s reference game and keep the Core Dynamics and Game Feel while reworking the Mechanics and Aesthetics (based on the MDA Model).
              We also had to get greenlit two times by the teachers to be allowed continuing the project.

        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          In the beginning, I was working as a General Designer and worked on multiple areas of the game.
          As the team grew, I was focusing more on Production and helping my team as Vision Holder while working on the Level Design and simple technical tasks to make sure we met our Deadlines.
          When we continued the project after our 8-week block, I got out of my comfort zone and started to help bug-fixing technical issues and implemented larger features than before.
          I also learned how to prepare a release on Steam and created the trailer with feedback from out cinematic team at the University.

      <h2>Game Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        Rail Recon is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_Action">„Elevator Action“</a> developed by Taito in 1983.
        The project brief's goal was to choose a game from the 1980’s and re-design its mechanics and aesthetics while keeping the dynamics of the reference game.
        </br></br>
        I wanted to make sure to follow the project brief and not just modernize the game but <span class="highlight"> make a new game that feels true to the reference game</span>.
        One of Elevator Action’s core dynamic is Pathfinding. The player has to re-strategize constantly and find a new path, due to the changing environment and partially unpredictable enemy behavior.
        </br></br>
        To keep the core dynamic of Pathfinding, <span class="highlight">we had to find a way to limit the player’s movement while also giving enough interesting options.</span> As a result, we created the rail-based movement and built the whole game around it.
        We created a game in which the player must respond quickly and keep an eye out for a path while being under fire.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="six columns">
      <h3>Deadlines</h3>
      <p>
        The biggest challenge during this project (and other teams) were the deadlines. We had two deadlines and on each 50% of the projects got cut and reassigned to other teams.
        </br></br>
        For the first deadline (Greenlight Pitch) we had two weeks and pitch the concept with a video of a prototype & and art mockup.
        Challenging for this Deadline was the lack of programming power as our only programmer got ill before the actual deadline.
        However, we got together as a team and decided to make a video of a paper prototype as an emergency solution.
        Gladly we were able to use the time left to create an effective pitch and Art Mockups which got the project greenlit.
        </br></br>
        For the second deadline (First Deliverable), we had another two weeks to create a playable prototype and got an additional 3 members. This was a challenge since we didn’t have much running in-engine.
        </br>
        But thanks to a clear vision and the additional manpower we created a prototype that demonstrated solid gameplay and got approved and complimented by the teachers.

    <div class="six columns">
      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Due to our unique movement system we didn’t have many pre-built tools within UE4 to place rails and nodes for them.
        The first level we created (now Level 6) took multiple days of work to get into a presentable state.
        <br>
        Communicating this problem to our programmers proved to be crucial.
        During the following weeks, they created tools that improved the process and saved 2/3 of time. This gave us Designers more time to iterate.

      <h2>Deadlines</h2>
      <p>
        Challenging for every team during this period were the deadlines. We had two deadlines on which 50% of the projects got cut and reassigned to other projects.
        For the first deadline had two weeks to create a concept and pitch the concept with a video of a prototype & mockup. For the second deadline we had another two weeks to create a playable prototype.
        </br></br>
        This was tight schedule and a challenge to create a solid concept within this time. While we couldn’t change the schedule, we were able to focus on the important things to demonstrate a solid project during the deadline presentations.
      </p>
      <h2>Level Design tools</h2>
      <p>
        Due to our unique movement system we didn’t had much tools within Unreal Engine 4 to lay down the Rails and the logic for them.
        The First level we created (currently Level 6) took multiple days of work to get into a presentable state.
        Just placing Rails and Nodes (The logic behind it) took more than a day to create and bugfix.
        Thanks to good communication with the programmers and them having a good grasp on tools it took at least 2/3 less time to place the rails and their logic.
        </br>
        Level seen on the right took 1 hour of placing art Assets and 1.5hours of placing the Nodes for the Rails.
      </p>
      <h2>Ill team member</h2>
      <p>
        Sadly, our only programmer got ill during the first two weeks of the project as a emergency solution
        we showed a video of paper prototype instead of an UE4 prototype besides the solid 3D Mockups during the deadline presentation.

        <h3>Level Design</h3>
        <p>
          During the project I was designing mutliple levels.
          In the beginning of the project it was challenging to create levels effectively due to a lack of tools.
          However, during the following weeks the programmers were creating helpful tools to save us time.


          A big inspiration came from labyrinths

    <div class="six columns">

      <h3>What to keep doing?</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          During the project, I learned how important it is be to listen to your teacher (or other parties) and find the important piece of advice they want to give.
          If the other party feels listened to they feel more involved in the project and give better feedback as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          I learned, when suggestionsgiven by clients are good but could prove problematic, it's always best to check with the team.
          If there is a valid reason we shouldn't apply it 1:1.
        </li>
        <li>
          Making Backup Builds as internal deadlines the day before can help reducing stress on the actual deadline as the team can focus more on improving the build.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using Team meetings after deadlines to get a new focus and new motivation within the team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if a very challenging situation occurs it is important to focus on the things you can still change and make them even better.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="six columns">
    <h3>What to do better?</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        Important tasks should be assigned to easy to reach team members for faster communication and iteration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create Feature teams according to one feature for one sprint and having one main communicator in each team to streamline communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve Leadership skills by finding my own sweet spot between being myself and being strict, when I think it is beneficial for the project or the teamwork.
      </li>
      <li>
        I need to communicate and ask progress updates regularly if the person is not proactive themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close to critical deadlines, I need to be stricter about what goes into the build.
