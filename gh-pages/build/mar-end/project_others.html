      <h2>Game Reference</h2>
      <p>
        Rail Recon is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_Action">„Elevator Action“</a> developed by Taito in 1983.
        The project brief's goal was to choose a 1980’s reference game and keep the Core Dynamics and Game Feel while reworking the mechanics and visual aesthetics (based on the MDA Model).
        </br></br>
        Elevator Action’s core dynamic is Pathfinding. The player has to re-strategize constantly and find a new path, due to the changing environment and rather unpredictable enemy behavior.
        </br></br>
        To keep tis Dynamic, <span class="highlight">we had to find a way to limit the player’s movement while also giving enough interesting choices.</span>
        As a result, we created the rail-based movement and built the whole game around it. The player must respond quickly and keep an eye out for a path while being under fire.

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        <h4>Deadlines</h4>
        The biggest challenge during this project were the deadlines. On each of the two deadlines, 50% of the Y1 projects got cut and reassigned to other teams.
        </br></br>
        <h4>Greenlight Pitch</h4>
        The first challenge was the lack of programming power when our only programmer got ill before the Greenlight Pitch.
        However, we got together as a team and decided to make a video of a paper prototype instead of a UE4 Prototype as an emergency solution.
        were able to use the time left to create an effective pitch and Art Mockups which got the project greenlit.
        </br></br>
        <h4>First Deliverable</h4>
        After getting greenlit we face another challenge, we only had two weeks to create a playable prototype starting with very little.
        Thanks to the additional 3 members we got a clear vision we created a playable prototype with a solid core loop that got approved and complimented by the teachers.

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Due to our Node and Spline based movement system we didn’t have many pre-built tools within UE4.
      </br></br>
        Communicating this problem to our programmers proved to be crucial.
        During the following weeks, they created tools that improved the process and saved 2/3 of time. This gave us Designers more time to iterate.

      <h2>Deadlines</h2>
      <p>
        Challenging for every team during this period were the deadlines. We had two deadlines on which 50% of the projects got cut and reassigned to other projects.
        For the first deadline had two weeks to create a concept and pitch the concept with a video of a prototype & mockup. For the second deadline we had another two weeks to create a playable prototype.
        </br></br>
        This was tight schedule and a challenge to create a solid concept within this time. While we couldn’t change the schedule, we were able to focus on the important things to demonstrate a solid project during the deadline presentations.
      </p>
      <h2>Level Design tools</h2>
      <p>
        Due to our unique movement system we didn’t had much tools within Unreal Engine 4 to lay down the Rails and the logic for them.
        The First level we created (currently Level 6) took multiple days of work to get into a presentable state.
        Just placing Rails and Nodes (The logic behind it) took more than a day to create and bugfix.
        Thanks to good communication with the programmers and them having a good grasp on tools it took at least 2/3 less time to place the rails and their logic.
        </br>
        Level seen on the right took 1 hour of placing art Assets and 1.5hours of placing the Nodes for the Rails.
      </p>
      <h2>Ill team member</h2>
      <p>
        Sadly, our only programmer got ill during the first two weeks of the project as a emergency solution
        we showed a video of paper prototype instead of an UE4 prototype besides the solid 3D Mockups during the deadline presentation.

      <h3>What to keep doing?</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          During the project, I learned the importance to make your clients feel listened to. They feel more involved in the project and give better feedback as well.
          Even if something might not be clear from the beginning ask and find the golden nuggets of advice they want to give.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if a very challenging situation occurs it is important to focus on the things you can still change and make them even better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Making Backup Builds before the actual Deadlines to reduce stress on the actual deadline.
        </li>

        <!--
        <li>
          Using Team meetings after deadlines to get a new focus and new motivation within the team.

    <h3>What to do better?</h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        Got Feedback from Jason van den Bergh (Creative Director of For Honor) that instead of creating a Game and then the tutorial.
        We should just create the tutorial as the game. Teaching the game along the way. While we addressed this Feedback before release I still want to keep this in mind for future projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close to critical deadlines, I need to be stricter about what goes into the build. Not matter if I'm doing Production or Design.
      </li>

      <!--
      <li>
        Important tasks should be assigned to team members on location for faster communication and iteration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create feature teams according to one feature for one sprint. Hav one main communicator in each team to streamline communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        I need to communicate and ask progress updates regularly if the person is not proactive themselves.
